# css-flexbox

CSS flexbox. I'll be honest, I'am not a fan of CSS flexbox. But as I create this project I realize that CSS flexbox is more useful than I think. Maybe I'am just not paying attention too much that's why I disregard CSS flexbox. But now, I know that CSS flexbox will help me solve a giving task and a problem.
